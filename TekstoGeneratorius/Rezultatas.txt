 this tea is a mirror pointed inward if the soul of its maker is clouded the tea will be as well so is it fear that clouds this cup or bewilderment speak master goa sue you have said something often to make mistakes but learn from them thus forging a better world that is the essence of a mortal spirit but as far as i can see mortals do not learn this way at all planet barber is no outlier master you've seen this countless times before patient zamasu every seed needs time to grow gardens are tended not just watched should a gardener not pluck the weeds when i was invited here i thought you would teach me divine justice what all you seem to do is watch while these monsters stay in existence with each other's blood zamasu do you ever ponder the relationship between good evil and justice yes all the time evil is the great obstacle to good and justice the sword by which good can overcome this obstacle and flourish that is one perspective but i have come to view it this way justice is not a sword eradicating evil but a scale keeping good and evil in balance balance master one can succumb to evil but reject that darkness and rediscover the light with new understanding justice makes that journey possible evil informs good and that is why we give the mortals their minds you give corruption far too much credit evil does not inform good it sullies it like the barbary sullied their world with violence and that arrogant goku sullied this sacred ground by swinging his fists at a god mortals received the divine gift of intellect the potential for wisdom but they misuse it to destroy the beauty of creation mortals do not succumb to evil they are the evil they create it and spread it with minds they shouldn't possess how can we call ourselves gods if we watch this plight and do nothing to stop it zamasu you have a strong hunger for justice and that can be a great thing but we must put temperance over righteousness and guide lost children to the good path at a pace that seems slow even for us do not forget the true reason you have honed your fighting ability is to strengthen your mind for your journey toward enlightenment being gods does not make us perfect we too must learn and mature over time on our discussion as you make more tea merely watching that's a sin too don't you see
