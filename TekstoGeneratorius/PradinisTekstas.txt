00:04
this tea
00:05
is a mirror pointed inward if the soul
00:08
of its maker is clouded
00:09
the tea will be as well so is it fear
00:13
that clouds this cup or bewilderment
00:16
speak master goa sue you have said
00:19
something often
00:21
to make mistakes but learn from them
00:23
thus forging a better world
00:24
that is the essence of a mortal spirit
00:29
but as far as i can see mortals do not
00:31
learn this way at all
00:33
planet barber is no outlier master
00:35
you've seen this countless times before
00:37
patient zamasu every seed needs time to
00:41
grow
00:43
gardens are tended not just watched
00:46
should a gardener not
00:47
pluck the weeds when i was invited here
00:50
i thought you would teach me divine
00:51
justice
00:52
what all you seem to do is watch while
00:54
these monsters stay in existence with
00:56
each other's blood
01:04
zamasu do you ever ponder the
01:06
relationship between
01:08
good evil and justice yes
01:11
all the time evil is the great obstacle
01:14
to good
01:15
and justice the sword by which good can
01:16
overcome this obstacle and flourish
01:19
that is one perspective but i have come
01:21
to view it this way
01:23
justice is not a sword eradicating evil
01:25
but a scale keeping good and evil in
01:27
balance
01:28
balance master one can succumb to evil
01:31
but reject that darkness and rediscover
01:34
the light with new understanding
01:36
justice makes that journey possible evil
01:38
informs good
01:40
and that is why we give the mortals
01:42
their minds
01:50
you give corruption far too much credit
01:52
evil does not inform good
01:55
it sullies it like the barbary sullied
01:58
their world with violence
01:59
and that arrogant goku sullied this
02:01
sacred ground by swinging his fists at a
02:03
god
02:04
mortals received the divine gift of
02:06
intellect the potential for wisdom
02:08
but they misuse it to destroy the beauty
02:11
of creation
02:13
mortals do not succumb to evil they are
02:15
the evil
02:16
they create it and spread it with minds
02:19
they shouldn't possess
02:20
how can we call ourselves gods if we
02:23
watch this plight and do nothing to stop
02:25
it
02:30
zamasu you have a strong hunger for
02:32
justice and that can be a great thing
02:35
but we must put temperance over
02:37
righteousness and guide lost children to
02:39
the good path at a pace that seems slow
02:42
even for us
02:43
do not forget the true reason you have
02:45
honed your fighting ability is to
02:47
strengthen your mind for your journey
02:49
toward enlightenment
02:51
being gods does not make us perfect we
02:54
too
02:54
must learn and mature over time
03:04
on our discussion as you make more tea
03:12
merely watching that's a sin too
03:16
don't you see
